# ðŸŒ¸ WHO AM I?

hi. i'm violet. 
i'm autistic, israeli, and write code like it owes me money.
i build tools nobody asked for and release them at 4 AM because sleep is an optional side quest i declined.

i specialize in:
- reverse engineering malware and sometimes god
- cybersecurity, information security, and open source intelligence
- low-level internals, custom bytecode, and weird file formats
- hiding data where it shouldn't go, and finding it where others won't
- building zero-bloat, high-impact tooling with precision and structure

i care about clean code, predictable logic, and systems that do exactly what they're told. *which is why most of them are now under psychiatric evaluation.*
